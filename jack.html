      This is Jack. He's an odd little boy
      thats just got an empty box for his birthday.
      He may <i>look</i> happy, but he's a <i>little</i> disappointed
      Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jack would really like...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Roller blades
      </li>
      <li>
        Magic tricks
      </li>
      <li>
        Anything Pokemon
      </li>
      <li>
        A motorized Lego set
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can get all this (and more) at an online
      toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="http://www.toysrus.com">toysrus.com</a>
      and <a href="http://www.juguettos.com">juguettos.com</a>
